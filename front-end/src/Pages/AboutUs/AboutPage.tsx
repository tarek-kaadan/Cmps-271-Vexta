              Vexta was developed as part of the CMPS 271-Software Engineering course at the
              American University of Beirut (AUB) during the Spring 2025 semester. The project was
              brought to life by a group of four computer science students:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Ali Saad</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tarek Kaadan</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hussein Marji</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Alfred Nahas</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Guided by <strong>Dr. Sari Al Lakkis</strong>, our course instructor, we aimed to
              create a web application that would bring together traditional games from different
              cultures and provide users with an engaging platform to explore them. Through this
              project, we sought to blend our passion for technology with our appreciation for
              global cultures and games.
            </p>

            <p>
              We hope that Vexta helps you rediscover the joy of timeless games and connects you to
              cultures worldwide!
